# ASWViewer
A viewer for Arc System Works scripts and hitboxes written in Godot. Currently only supports Guilty Gear -Strive-. It also displays the models and animations corresponding to the viewed frames.

To switch to a different frame, select a "sprite" from the script view.

This makes use of my personal forks of https://github.com/super-continent/bbscript and https://github.com/super-continent/arcsys/. I have not pushed the correct branches yet, please wait for the source.
